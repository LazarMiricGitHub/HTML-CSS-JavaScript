                    <p>Jim Carrey, in full James Eugene Carrey, 
                    (born January 17, 1962, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada), Canadian 
                    American comedian who established himself as a leading
                     comedic actor with a series of over-the-top 
                     performances and who won plaudits for his 
                     more-serious portrayals as his career progressed.</p>
                    <p>He made his professional debut as a stand-up comedian 
                     in a Toronto club at age 15 and by 1979 he was able
                     to make a living as a comedian. He wrote most of 
                     his own material as an opening act for such comics 
                     as Buddy Hackett and Rodney Dangerfield.</p>
